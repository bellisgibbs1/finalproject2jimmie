              <h1>  <center> The Black Appearance and Commodity </center>  </h>
          
              <h2> <center>  By:  Jimmie McKinney & Uvie Bikomo </center> </h2> 
                   

            <p>On Feb. 9, 2022, Vogue magazine announced that celebrity multihyphenate Kim Kardashian would fill the front page of their March issue. For the cover look, Kardashian wearing a white and blue Loewe dress gives a deadpan stare while sitting slightly to the side on the floor. The image, along with a few of the others included in the article, sparked some outrage on social media regarding Kardashian&rsquo;s darkened makeup.</p>

            <p>Some accused her of blackfishing, an internet slang referring to the use of makeup, tanners, plastic surgery and more to create the appearance of traditionally Black features by non-Black individuals, which has become a widely-known issue. For many Black Americans, acceptance of their beauty in the western world has often been difficult as many of their features have been seen as unfavorable. This latest version of appropriation exploits these same features.</p>
            
            <p>Blackfishing allows non-Black people to disguise themselves with superficial ideas of Blackness. Consequently, this reinforces ideas that being Black in a Western context is an exotic trait or aesthetic, rather than an extension of identity. This reduces Blackness to a choice of expression - no different than fashion.</p>

  <p> And like with fashion, the idea of being recognised for your aesthetic decisions is a motivator and accolade. Some blackfishers are also social media influencers, leveraging their unabashed appearance for financial gain and internet stardom.</p>

  <p>For years, against the backdrop of the Western world, Black beauty has been depicted as undesirable and ugly. Saartjie Baartman, an 18th-century African woman with distinct features, got paraded across Europe as an exhibit for her curvy body, essentially robbing her of all humanity. This marks one of multiple instances where Blackness has been subjected to nothing more than the inhuman.</p>

<p>This series highlights the beauty and pride Black people have for their natural features and tones. As well as, the practice of accenting those features with skin care, make-up, and styling.</p>

<p>Images of women blackfishing on the social media outlet Instagram were archived. Images like these are uploaded regularly on their accounts.</p>

  <p> <strong> Kendell Dempster: </strong></p>


<p>Kendell Dempster, a 37-year-old makeup artist, saw his gift as a new escape after giving up dance.</p>

<p>After spending years in the entertainment business as a dancer with the Lustig Dance Theatre, a mishap caused Dempster to take a turn down this new route. While playing the principal lead in Beauty and The Beast Dempster slipped and got a concussion forcing him to leave the company.</p>
<p>Dempster turned to makeup as a way to stay connected to the industry and hone-in on a skill he loved.</p>

<p>"I had always kind of done makeup in school and on my friends before,"" Dempster says. "So, I started freelancing and then eventually did makeup full-time at M.A.C. cosmetics." </p>

<p>As a dancer, Demptser often found himself in predominantly white spaces. Unfortunately, the lack of representation changed to a different problem in his move into this new space. Now, Dempster has found himself in positions where he has been forced to recreate moments some might see as blackfishing.</p>

<p>"Sometimes ladies at some beauty counters will want darker shades or fuller lips," Dempster says. "Often, it's European women who request this as a nighttime, going-out look." </p>

<p>Working at a beauty counter, Demspter could hardly refuse his clients' requests, an issue he would have to deal with by himself.</p>
